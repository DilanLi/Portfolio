        I grew up in China and moved to Utah at the age of 14. Growing up in two distinct cultures, I became a
        person who likes to maintain an open perspective and a curious mind. I love traveling, books, coffee,
        animals, good food, video games, and much more.
        <br/><br/>
        My earned a Bachelor in Fine Arts from the University of Utah in 2018. I make illustrations, paintings,
        murals and am familiar with Adobe Creative Suite Softwares. My work has been featured in
        organizations such as the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and the Artists of Utah 15 Bytes Magazine. Pretty quickly after graduation, I realized I have a personality that seeks structure, functionality and
        efficiency beyond my artist identity. This led me to develope an interest for web development, and I
        fell in love with the sense of achievement brought by solving problems. I was surprised that I can be
        equally if not more
        creative when it comes to tackling an issue.
        <br/><br/>
        To symstematically sharpen my skills, I enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of
        Utah and acquired knowledge in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Responsive Web Design and Mobile Design. I also became familiar with backend
        operations which involves NodeJs, Express Servers,
        MySQL and MongoDB database, etc. I prefer not to be defined by the things I have learned, but by my ability to focus and learn new
        technologies quickly.
        <br/><br/>
        I am excited to dive into the new tech industry and at the same time leverage my imaginative approaches
        from art.
